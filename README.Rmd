The goal of this article is to demonstrate how to visualise animated traces in an interactive map with R.

You can set-up a basic animated map with `mapdeck` as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(mapdeck)
library(sf)
mapdeck(
location = c(145, -37.8)
, zoom = 10
, style = mapdeck_style("dark")
, token = Sys.getenv("MAPBOX")
) %>%
 add_trips(
   data = sf
   , animation_speed = 2000
   , trail_length = 1000
   , stroke_colour = "#FFFFFF"
)

```

```{r}
f_gpx = "../gigwork.github.io/data/01._Adnan_aka_Adeeb/01._.gpx_file/strava_4658971578.g"
trace =
```

There is also a way to do it with the `rdeck` package but this package is not mature or well documented at present.

```{r}
remotes::install_github("anthonynorth/rdeck")
library(rdeck)
?rdeck::trips_layer
```
